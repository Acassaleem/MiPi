How to Run MyPi Language Interpreter

MyPi is a Python-based interpreter, so it does not require traditional "building" (compiling). You just need Python installed.

---

1.  **Software Needed:**
    * **Python 3.12:** This specific version was used for development.

2.  **Project Setup:**
    * Unzip the MyPi project folder to your computer.
    * Open your terminal or command prompt.
    * Go into the unzipped project folder. (This folder contains `main.py` and other `.py` files).

        Example:
        ```bash
        cd C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads\MyPi
        ```

        * **Create Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
        This step creates an isolated Python environment for your project.
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        ```

    * **Activate Virtual Environment:**
        You must activate the virtual environment *before* running `main.py` in the same terminal session.
        * **Windows (PowerShell):**
            ```bash
            .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
            ```
        * **Linux / macOS (Bash):**
            ```bash
            source ./.venv/bin/activate
            ```
        Your terminal prompt should change (e.g., `(.venv) PS C:\Users\...>`) to indicate the virtual environment is active.

3.  **Run MyPi Code:**
    * Use the `python` command to run `main.py`, and give it your MyPi code file.

        Example:
        ```bash
        python main.py examples/my_program.txt
        ```
        (Replace `examples/my_program.txt with your actual file path).

    * The interpreter will run your code. Output from `print` statements will show in the terminal. If your code uses `input()`, the terminal will ask for your input.

**Troubleshooting:**
* **"No such file or directory"**: Make sure you are in the correct folder where `main.py` is.
* **"charmap' codec error"**: Your `.mipi` file has hidden characters. Open it in a text editor (like VS Code), resave it as **UTF-8**, and replace any fancy quotes (`“ ”`) with simple ones (`" "`).
* **"Runtime error"**: Your MyPi code itself has an error. The message will tell you what happened and on what line.
